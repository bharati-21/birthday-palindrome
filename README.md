# Birthday Palindrome
An application created using JavaScipt that tells the user if their birth date is a palindrome or not.

### Application created using JavaScript that tells the user if their birthdate is a palindrome. If not, then it displays the nearest palindrome date and by how many days user missed it.

## WORKING
1. User enters their birthdate.
2. The user is told whether their birthdate is a palindrome or not. The date is checked in 4 formats: <em>mm-dd-yyyy</em>, <em>dd-mm-yyyy</em>, <em>mm-dd-yy</em>, and <em>yyyy-mm-dd</em>
3. If the user's birth date is not a palindrome, the application finds the previous or next nearest palindromic date to the birthday and informs the user by how many days they missed.
